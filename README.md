# WebSocket Basics

This repository contains the basics of WebSocket implementation, demonstrating real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers. The project is structured with multiple examples to help understand WebSocket concepts.

## Project Structure

### 1. Echo_BE (Backend)
A TypeScript-based WebSocket server implementation that:
- Handles WebSocket connections
- Processes incoming messages
- Sends echo responses back to clients
- Built with Node.js and TypeScript

### 2. Echo_FE (Frontend)
A modern frontend application built with:
- Vue.js
- TypeScript
- Vite as build tool
- Demonstrates WebSocket client implementation
- Features a user interface for sending and receiving messages

### 3. WebSocket
A basic WebSocket implementation example that serves as a foundation for understanding WebSocket concepts.

```bash
cd Echo_BE
npm install
npm run build
